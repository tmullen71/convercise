## About Convercise

Convercise is a realtime environment for language exchange, where pairs
of learners of each other's languages can improve their language skills
by collaborating on communicative puzzles. It is currently under development.

A demo is available on [Heroku](https://vast-escarpment-6568.herokuapp.com).
